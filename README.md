# Game
Resturant App

Summer project of 2019. I Desided that I wanted to tryout making an app for iOS,
so i began learning swift, spritekit and how to use the UIKit.

The game was never finished, because the gameplay simply wasn't very rewarding, but might pick this one up later again.

Here's how it looked before i stopped development (I'm no designer, mind you): https://mega.nz/#!bEIQQIYY!_PoRcO1OqubW5WBPJPsA8RW0hXcwBZ8BSLdgdNfrOPY
